    "# Ontology-Aware Knowledge Extraction: From Text to Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **ontology-driven entity extraction** using large language models (LLMs) to transform unstructured text into structured RDF knowledge graphs. Unlike traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems, this approach leverages the semantic understanding of modern LLMs combined with formal ontologies to achieve **concept-aware extraction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Challenge: Ambiguous Terms in Unstructured Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus (`jaguar_corpus.txt`) contains information about multiple entities that share the word \"Jaguar\":\n",
    "- 🐆 **Wildlife jaguars** (Panthera onca) - the big cat species\n",
    "- 🚗 **Jaguar cars** (E-Type, XK-E) - luxury automobiles\n",
    "- 🎸 **Fender Jaguar** - electric guitars\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional keyword-based extraction would indiscriminately extract all \"Jaguar\" mentions, creating noise and confusion in our knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: Ontology-Driven Knowledge Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing the LLM with our **jaguar conservation ontology** (`jaguar_ontology.ttl`), the model understands:\n",
    "- The **domain context** (wildlife conservation)\n",
    "- The **class hierarchy** (Jaguar → Animal → Species)\n",
    "- The **properties and relationships** (hasGender, occursIn, monitoredByOrg)\n",
    "- The **semantic structure** of our knowledge domain\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM uses this ontological understanding to:\n",
    "1. **Filter relevant entities** - Only extract wildlife-related jaguars\n",
    "2. **Recognize relationships** - Identify connections between jaguars, locations, organizations, threats\n",
    "3. **Generate aligned RDF** - Produce Turtle syntax that perfectly matches our ontology structure\n",
    "4. **Infer implicit relationships** - Connect entities based on contextual understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "## Knowledge Graphs vs. Traditional Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge Graphs (RDF/SPARQL)** enable:\n",
    "- **Formal ontologies** that define domain semantics\n",
    "- **Schema flexibility** with open-world assumptions\n",
    "- **Reasoning capabilities** through RDFS/OWL inference\n",
    "- **Semantic interoperability** across datasets\n",
    "- **Context-aware querying** with SPARQL\n",

    "## Why This Requires RDF and Formal Ontologies\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Limitations of Labeled Property Graphs (LPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ontology-driven extraction approach **cannot be replicated** with LPG databases like Neo4j for fundamental architectural reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **No Formal Ontologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "**LPG databases lack formal ontology support:**\n",
    "- Labels and relationship types are just **strings**, not semantically defined concepts\n",
    "- No formal class hierarchies (RDFS/OWL)\n",
    "- No property domain/range definitions\n",
    "- No reasoning or inference capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** In Neo4j, you might have:\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "(:Jaguar {name: \"El Jefe\"})-[:OCCURS_IN]->(:Location {name: \"Arizona\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But the LLM has no formal structure to understand:\n",
    "- What a `Jaguar` node represents (could be a car, guitar, or animal)\n",
    "- What properties `Jaguar` should have\n",
    "- What relationships are valid\n",
    "- How concepts relate hierarchically\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **No Semantic Standards**\n",
    "\n",
    "**RDF provides W3C standards:**\n",
    "- **RDFS** (Resource Description Framework Schema) - defines classes, properties, hierarchies\n",
    "- **OWL** (Web Ontology Language) - enables reasoning and inference\n",
    "- **SHACL** - validates data shapes\n",
    "- **SKOS** - manages vocabularies and taxonomies\n",
    "\n",
    "**LPG has:**\n",
    "- Vendor-specific schemas (Neo4j, TigerGraph, etc.)\n",
    "- No formal semantics\n",
    "- No standardized reasoning\n",
    "- No interoperability guarantees\n",

    "### 3. **Knowledge Representation vs. Data Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | RDF/SPARQL (Knowledge Graphs) | LPG (Neo4j, etc.) |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Schema** | Formal ontologies (RDFS/OWL) | Informal schemas |\n",
    "| **Semantics** | Explicit, machine-readable | Implicit, application-level |\n",
    "| **Reasoning** | Built-in (RDFS/OWL inference) | Application-specific |\n",

    "| **LLM Guidance** | Rich semantic structure | Just node/edge labels |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Why LLMs Need Ontologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "When extracting knowledge, the LLM requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **With RDF Ontologies:**\n",
    "- Formal class definitions (`ont:Jaguar rdfs:subClassOf ont:Animal`)\n",
    "- Property domains and ranges (`ont:hasGender rdfs:domain ont:Jaguar ; rdfs:range xsd:string`)\n",
    "- Relationship semantics (`ont:monitoredByOrg rdfs:range ont:Organization`)\n",
    "- Hierarchical understanding (taxonomies)\n",
    "- Validation rules (cardinality, data types)\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **With LPG:**\n",
    "- Just strings: `\"Jaguar\"`, `\"OCCURS_IN\"`, `\"Location\"`\n",
    "- No formal meaning\n",
    "- No hierarchical structure\n",
    "- No validation constraints\n",
    "- No way to distinguish domain concepts from noise\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **The \"Jaguar Problem\" Revisited**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without formal ontologies**, an LLM extracting to LPG would:\n",
    "- Struggle to disambiguate jaguars (cars vs. animals)\n",
    "- Have no semantic guidance on valid properties\n",
    "- Create inconsistent graph structures\n",
    "- Require extensive post-processing and validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**With RDF ontologies**, the LLM:\n",
    "- Understands domain semantics from formal definitions\n",
    "- Generates semantically valid, structured data\n",
    "- Automatically filters irrelevant entities\n",
    "- Produces interoperable, standards-compliant knowledge\n",

    "## Conclusion: Knowledge Graphs Enable Semantic AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how **formal ontologies** (RDFS/OWL) transform LLMs from text processors into **semantic knowledge miners**. By grounding extraction in formal semantics, we achieve:\n",
