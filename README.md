# Semantic Graph RAG with Maplib

**Build Knowledge Graphs directly from DataFrames. No vector databases required.**

This project demonstrates a **deterministic, high-precision Graph RAG** system for structured data. It targets Data Scientists and AI Engineers who want to build reliable agents over tabular data without losing the semantic structure to vector embeddings.

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- **Data Scientists**: You love Polars/Pandas but you are struggling with knowledge graphs. Here is your help
- **AI Engineers**: You have made unlimited vector RAGs on un-structured data. But you struggle with structured data.
- **Data Engineers**: You want a reproducible pipeline (ETL) from CSV to Knowledge Graph that fits into your existing Python workflows.

## 🧠 The Core Concept: "Don't Embed, Map."

Standard RAG takes structured data (like a CSV), turns it into text chunks, embeds it, and then searches for "similar" chunks. This destroys the exact relationships in your data.

**Graph RAG with Maplib** preserves the structure:

1.  **Define an Ontology (Schema)**: What are the "things" (Classes) and "relationships" (Properties)?
2.  **Create a Template (OTTR)**: How does a row in your DataFrame map to that Ontology?
3.  **Map**: Transform the DataFrame into a Graph in milliseconds.
4.  **Query**: Let the Agent write SPARQL to query the graph precisely.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_RESPONSES_MODEL_ID=gpt-4
```


### 2. The "Hello World" of Graph Mapping

This is all the code you need to turn a CSV into a queryable Knowledge Graph.

```python
import polars as pl
from maplib import Model

# 1. Load your Data (It's just a DataFrame!)
df = pl.read_csv("data/jaguars.csv")
# ... (minimal preprocessing to create IRI strings) ...

# 2. Initialize the Graph & Load Schema
model = Model()
model.read("data/jaguar_ontology.ttl", format="turtle")

# 3. Define the Mapping (OTTR Template)
# "Map this DataFrame to the 'JaguarInstance' template"
model.add_template(open("data/jaguar_template.ottr").read())
model.map("http://example.org/ontology#JaguarInstance", df)

# 4. Query (SPARQL)
# "Find all jaguars that were killed"
results = model.query("""
    PREFIX ont: <http://example.org/ontology#>
    SELECT ?name ?cause WHERE {
        ?j a ont:Jaguar ;
           rdfs:label ?name ;
           ont:wasKilled true ;
           ont:causeOfDeath ?cause .
    }
""")
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### Why Maplib?
*   **Rust Core**: Built on Rust for performance, with Python bindings.
*   **Polars Integration**: Uses Apache Arrow for zero-copy data transfer. It's extremely fast.
*   **In-Memory**: Operates like a DataFrame—load it, map it, query it. No external database server (Neo4j/GraphDB) required for the application runtime.

### The Pipeline
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[CSV/Parquet] -->|Polars| B(DataFrame)
    B -->|Maplib + OTTR| C(Knowledge Graph)
    D[Ontology .ttl] --> C
    E[Agent / LLM] -->|Generates SPARQL| C
    C -->|Returns Results| E
```

## 🤖 Agent Integration (The "AI" Part)

### Features

-   **Microsoft Agent Framework** for conversation management
-   **OpenAI GPT-4** powered conversational interface
-   **Function calling** for dynamic SPARQL query generation
-   **Context-aware** responses based on graph data
-   **Thread-based state management** for conversation persistence

### How it Works

Instead of "retrieving context" via vector similarity, the Agent acts as a **Semantic Query Engine**.

1.  **User Query**: "Show me rescued jaguars that were released."
2.  **LLM**: Understands the schema (`ont:isReleased`, `ont:rescuedBy`) and generates a SPARQL query.
3.  **Maplib Tool**: Executes the exact SPARQL query against the in-memory graph.
4.  **Response**: The LLM summarizes the precise results.

## 🆚 Comparison: Vector RAG vs. Maplib Graph RAG

| Feature | Vector RAG (Standard) | Graph RAG (Maplib) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Source** | Unstructured Text | Structured (CSV/SQL/JSON) |
| **Retrieval** | Fuzzy Similarity (Cosine) | Exact Query (SPARQL) |
| **Accuracy** | Probabilistic (Can Hallucinate) | Deterministic (100% Precision) |
| **Reasoning** | Limited by context window | Infinite (via Graph Logic) |
| **Setup** | Chunking + Embedding | Ontology + Mapping Template |
